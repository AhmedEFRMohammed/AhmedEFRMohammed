I am a Water Engineer 🌊 who developed a passion for software development 💻

I am proficient in HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and Python 😎  and currently learning Golang 📚

I am open to collaborate 👬 on software projects, in particular those pertaining to water 💧 agriculture 🌾 and the environment 🍀 and the cross-section between two or more of the aforementioned domains.

I am currently working on 🔭 my own personal projects 💾 on those themes as well.

Feel free to reach out and ask 💬 about anything that has to do with those themes and skillsets.

✨ Have a marvelous day ✨
